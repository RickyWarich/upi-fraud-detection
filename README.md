# upi-fraud-detection
Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions within the Indian Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system. Analyzed transaction data, identified patterns, and built a predictive model to mitigate financial risks.


This project focuses on developing a robust model for detecting fraudulent transactions within the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system. UPI, a popular real-time mobile payment system in India, has witnessed a surge in usage, making it crucial to implement effective fraud detection mechanisms.
This project leverages a dataset containing transaction details, including payment gateways, transaction types, locations, device information, and merchant categories, to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activities. The analysis involves exploring various features, visualizing transaction trends, and employing machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.
